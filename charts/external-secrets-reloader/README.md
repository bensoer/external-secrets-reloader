# External Secrets Reloader

External Secrets Reloader (ESR) allows you to have event-drive reloads of your External Secrets Operator's (ESO) `ExternalSecrets`.

ESO is great but its setup requires you either to fully embrace immutability and declarative deployments OR to constantly Poll the external service for changes. Under certain circumstances, the infrastructure and work for declarative deployments or the CSP bill from the constant poll, is not feasible. So this project is meant to fill that gap.

This chart deploys the External Secrets Reloader to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
helm repo add external-secrets-reloader https://bensoer.github.io/external-secrets-reloader
helm install my-release external-secrets-reloader/external-secrets-reloader
```
